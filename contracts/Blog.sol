        // here we define <theThingYou'reCreating> by using the mapping idToPost and feeding it the new id

        // really don't understand this. Which bit is actually doing the creating? shouldn't it be << idToPost[postId] = Post storage post >> ? Since we know what is on the right side but not what is on the left?

        // ah - from the docs: Mappings can be seen as hash tables which are virtually initialized such that every possible key exists and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros: a typeâ€™s default value.

        // so basically idToPost[withLiterallyAnythingInHere] returns a post, and that post will almost always have null values for every property

        // Post storage post = somePostObject will take that object, whack it in storage, and assign it to the variable name "post". Since solidity is statically typed, we can't just declare a variable without also declaring its type, so we declare it - as Post. In the same way that you'd write "string public name"
